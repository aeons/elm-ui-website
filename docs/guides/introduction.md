# Guides

This chapter contains patterns and solutions for common problems encountered when building web applications. The problems include:
* [Focusing arbitrary components and HTML Elements](guides/focusing.html)
* [Handling files](guides/handling_files.html)
* [Accessing environment variables](guides/environment_variables.html)
* Scrolling to different parts of the page
* Handling drag & drop interactions
* Creating drop down menus and panels

_The solutions and patterns for these problems are unique to Elm-UI at this point, mostly because there are no official way to handle these in pure Elm._

If you have a problem related to web applications and Elm-UI feel free to open an issue about it [here](https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-ui-guide/issues) and it can be part of this guide.
