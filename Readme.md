# Website of Elm-UI
This is the repository for the website of Elm-UI http://elm-ui.info.

## Running Locally
Everything is set up with Npm:

- Install dependencies (including Elm): `npm install`
- Starting the server: `npm start`
- Deployment: `npm run deploy`


## Documentation
The documentation is generated from the Elm-UI source code and copied over
to `public/documentation.json`, so if you find a typo it needs to be fixed
there.
